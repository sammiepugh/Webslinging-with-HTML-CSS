  <h1>Pittsburgh Blog for College Students</h1>
  <p>I have decided to pitch the idea that I want to make a blog about Pittsburgh. Not just a plain old blog about Pittsburgh, one that is directed towards college students. </p>
  <h2>What content would be displayed on the blog? Good Questions.</h2>
    <p>Some content ideas  include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Local happy hour deals</li>
      <li>Trendy restaurants and coffee shops, highlight good deals</li>
      <li>Fun and different events going on in Pittsburgh, both in and outside of Oakland </li>
      <li>Clothing and thrift stores</li>
      <li>Easy how to cooking videos</li>
      <li>Horoscope and monthly mood boards</li>
      <li>Open to plenty of other options!</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Goal of Making the Blog</h3>
<p>These are the skills that I would like to accomplish:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create an overall aesthetic and follow it through the entire project</li>
  <li>Create this using the HSS that we are working on now in class</li>
  <li>Also, use some of the other skills we learned in this class, like GIMP</li>
</ul>
