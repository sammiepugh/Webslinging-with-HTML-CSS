  <h1>Pittsburgh Blog </h1>
    <h2> for </h2>
     <h3> College Students</h3>
</div>
  <p> Have you ever found yourself sitting at home, not really sure what to do, but you know you want to do something different?
    Are there ever times on the weekend where you just want to get out of the house?
    You just aren't sure where to go? <strong> I know I have. </strong>
<section>
    To help solve this problem, I have decided to pitch the idea that I want to make a blog about Pittsburgh.
    Not just a plain old blog about Pittsburgh, one that is directed towards college students. It is a one stop shop to all the questions that you have been asking and a relief to your boredom. </section> </p>

  <h4>What content would be displayed on the blog? Good Question.</h4>
    <p>Some content ideas  include:</p>

  <h5>Goal of Making the Blog</h5>
<p>These are the skills that I would like to accomplish:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create an overall aesthetic and follow it through the entire project</li>
  <li>Create this using the HSS that we are working on now in class</li>
  <li>Also, use some of the other skills we learned in this class, like GIMP</li>
</ol>
<br>
<br>
<h6> What would everyone do? <h6>
<p> Here are some of the tasks that would need to be divided up within the group members: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Accumulate content for the different sections </li>
    <li> Help to code the html </li>
    <li> Style the CSS for the blog </li>
