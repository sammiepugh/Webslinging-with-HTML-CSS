  <h1>Pittsburgh Blog</h1>
  <p>I have decided to pitch the idea that I want to make a blog about Pittsburgh. </p>

  <h2>Goal of Making the Blog</h2>
<p>These are the skills that I would like to accomplish:</p>

<ul>
  <li>create an overall aesthetic and follow it through the entire project</li>
  <li>create this using the HSS that we are working on now in class</li>
  <li>also, use some of the other skills we learned in this class, like GIMP</li>
</ul>
