  <h1>Pittsburgh Blog </h1>
    <h2> for </h2>
     <h3> College Students</h3>
  <p> Have you ever found yourself sitting at home, not really sure what to do, but you know you want to do something different?
    Are there ever times on the weekend where you just want to get out of the house?
    You just aren't sure where to go? I know I have.
    To help solve this problem, I have decided to pitch the idea that I want to make a blog about Pittsburgh.
    Not just a plain old blog about Pittsburgh, one that is directed towards college students. </p>
  <h4>What content would be displayed on the blog? Good Questions.</h2>
    <p>Some content ideas  include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Local happy hour deals</li>
      <li>Trendy restaurants and coffee shops, highlight good deals</li>
      <li>Fun and different events going on in Pittsburgh, both in and outside of Oakland </li>
      <li>Clothing and thrift stores</li>
      <li>Easy how to cooking videos</li>
      <li>Horoscope and monthly mood boards</li>
      <li>Open to plenty of other options!</li>
    </ul>
  <h5>Goal of Making the Blog</h3>
<p>These are the skills that I would like to accomplish:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create an overall aesthetic and follow it through the entire project</li>
  <li>Create this using the HSS that we are working on now in class</li>
  <li>Also, use some of the other skills we learned in this class, like GIMP</li>
</ol>
